# song-list-analysis

Just a Kotlin script I use on Kotlin Playground, to do various analyses on song lists. Probably not much use to anyone but me, as it's based on the specific format I use for song lists.

- `SongListAnalysis.kt` - the main script
- `SongListTemplate.kt` - put it after the main script. I kept it separate just to make copy-pasting the script a bit quicker when the template has been populated
