# song-list-analysis

Just a Kotlin script I use on Kotlin Playground, intended as a place to put various analysis on song lists. So far it's only just been started, but I intend to develop it more. Probably not much use to anyone but me, as it's based on the specific format I use for song lists.

- `SongListAnalysis.kt` - the main script
- `SongListTemplate.kt` - put it after the main script. I kept it separate just to make copy-pasting the script a bit quicker when the template has been populated
